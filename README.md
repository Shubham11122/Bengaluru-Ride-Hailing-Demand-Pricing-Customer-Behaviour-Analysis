# Bangalore-Ride-Booking-Customer-Behaviour-Analysis
🚀 Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end analytics case study of a ride-hailing platform operating in Bengaluru city. The dashboard analyzes booking demand, revenue performance, cancellations, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction using SQL and Power BI.
The goal of this project is to identify business leakages, operational bottlenecks, and customer experience patterns through data-driven insights.

🎯 Business Problem

Ride-hailing platforms face multiple operational challenges:

High cancellation rates
Driver allocation delays
Demand-supply imbalance
Revenue leakage
Customer experience variability

This project aims to analyze these factors and recommend optimization opportunities.
